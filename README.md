# Jenkins DevKit

There are two purposes for this kit:

1. Building Jenkins Pipelines
2. Building Jenkins environments

## Building Jenkins Pipelines

Use Docker to stand up quick and easy Jenkins servers that can be used to develop pipelines.

## Building Jenkins environments

Develop automation to build disposable Jenkins servers for use with your organization.  Use local development tools to cloud provisioning tools.
